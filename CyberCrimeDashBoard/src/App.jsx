        Placeholder Text

        This is a placeholder for the Cyber Crime Dashboard application.

        I am going to slowly build this out with information from Operation Shamrock and St. Louis Data


        Will do my best to make it accessible for each neighborhood and City.


        TODO:
<br></br>
        Find data sources from Shamrock
        <br></br>
        find data sources from St. Louis Data 
        <br></br>
        Create visualizations for each data source, maybe compare St louis to total money vs us, do the same for scams lost.
        <br></br>
        
      </div>
    </>

export default App
